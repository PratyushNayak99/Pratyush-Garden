# An Old man who reminded me of something about Life…

>hello

So recently I had to go through too many exams.

Some went bad, some went okay—and being far away from home only made everything feel heavier.

So I felt I was missing many things. I had so many problems, and for some nights I thought, "Why am I the chosen one to face all the difficulties?" I work so hard for everything I do but still don’t get results. So ==yellow:WHY ME??==

Now after a hectic week I decided to go out for dinner.

It was the weekend, and the moment I stepped out from my hostel, it started raining (I looked at dark clouds from the corridor and smiled 🥹, chosen one…huh).

So I went back to the room, brought an umbrella, and then went out, and after 2-3 minutes the rain stopped, and I laughed at my fortune. So I was listening to a podcast and walking at a little bit of a pace.

After some time I couldn’t see any walkers and then saw that old man walking—bent down, umbrella in hand, moving fast despite the struggle—something shifted in me.

### The Old Man

Now I started walking slowly, and I felt something and removed my earphone, and I was just walking behind him.

Some will say this might seem very creepy, but actually I felt empathetic towards him because of the way he was walking at a little pace, and that too very uncomfortably because of his posture.

After observing him for some time, I automatically thanked God. I don't know why, but something actually made me feel ==yellow:GRATITUDE== towards everything I have.

I don’t know the full story of the OLD MAN, but I know he was struggling in his current condition.

And then I realized something that


>I do have problems, but those problems might be nothing for the person next to me.


That old man didn’t speak to me.

He didn’t teach me anything directly.

But just by walking ahead of me, He made me feel thankful to God.

### Ending:

After some time I increased my pace. He noticed we both looked at each other, and his phone rang, and I crossed him, hoping that the old man will reach safely to his destination.

>==yellow:So friends, always have gratitude for good people, good moments, and everything you have.==

I hope you will like this blog; I tried my best, and I will improve in the future. 

Thank you.
