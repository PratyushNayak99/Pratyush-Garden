# My First Short Film

Hello Guys so this is the first official blog I am going to write from the time I created this Garden,now this wont be like very professional or what you see in Linkedin Nowadays How people express their experiences, I feel its very fake and I really don't like it.
So lets keep this topic for some other day and lets talk about the Short Film which I almost completed with my team today.
While growing up I always thought how the videos I am watching in youtube are shot I never had a appreciation for directors or for the other crew members but again growing up over a period of time and watching so many movies made me realize that a A MOVIE IS NOTHING WITHOUT ITS CREW MEMBERS INCLUDING THE DIRECTOR,CAMERAMAN,CAST,ETC...
So today I completed a short film named LUNCHBOX
Now this was my College project and I really thought it was an Headache, but to be honest I really enjoyed the process and ofcourse it was because of the people I was working with.
But I realized something that we all do have some HEADACHES like I had but if you really start getting involved with the cause and with the people involved in that,then you can enjoy the whole process.
I will end the blog here as it is getting late and tomorrow I have to go to college. I will complete the story and details of the the short film in upcoming blogs.
Till then TRY TO BE HAPPY AND ENJOY IN WHATEVER YOU ARE PART OF

SEE YOU.....
